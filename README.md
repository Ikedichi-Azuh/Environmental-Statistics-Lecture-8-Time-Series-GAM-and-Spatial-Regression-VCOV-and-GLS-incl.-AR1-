# Environmental Statistics

## Lecture 8: Time Series, GAM and Spatial Regression: VCOV and GLS (incl. AR1)
This lecture introduces key concepts in environmental data analysis where observations are not independent in time or space.

For example, daily river discharge is often strongly influenced by previous days, and annual tree-ring growth depends on past climatic conditions. Similarly, spatial measurements such as soil contamination exhibit dependence between nearby locations. These dependencies violate the independence assumption of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and can lead to misleading inference if ignored.

This lecture distinguishes between two important sources of model misspecification:

- **Mean structure misspecification**, where the functional form of the relationship is incorrect (addressed using Generalized Additive Models, GAMs)
- **Covariance structure misspecification**, where residuals are correlated (addressed using Generalized Least Squares, GLS)

### Topics covered

- Autocorrelation in time and space  
- Diagnostic tools: ACF, PACF, correlograms, and variograms  
- Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) for flexible, non-linear trends  
- Generalized Least Squares (GLS) with AR(1) correlation structures  
- Implications for statistical inference and model interpretation
